## Requirements
1. Set up the IDE, for this application you will need to download the Arduino ide here if you don't have it already installed for your distributions
the arduino UNO board comes already installed with the download. if you need to use any other board supported by arduino you will have to install the support packages.
2. Download all the files on the `Code`:arrow_down_small: on this platform, In your downloads you will get the a folder :file_folder:  `laser_firmware`this will have:
     - laser_firmware
     - libraries
</br> and `Libraries` zip file -this contains all the related libraries used in the project

 ## Library Installation
 3. On library installation unzip the folder :file_folder: `libraries` in the downloaded folder :file_folder:, copy and paste all the folders to your directory `documents/arduino/library` folder :file_folder:
 4.  Open the `laser_firmware.ino`  in `laser_firmware`folder :file_folder: with the downloaded ide, compile and upload to the hardware that is the arduino uno board.
 for more check out (procedure on how to use the ide is on the tutorial link)`:link:    [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL34zDTPkcs&t=3s)
 
 ## Hardware setup.
 5. Please follow the tinkercad connection as shown [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2OciVETjter-swanky-migelo-waasa/editel?sharecode=0TgdtxdAeQiE40cOWNtAXAX4SZ7zAw_0Eh1uFHE40ho)
 The physical connection and schematic connection are demonstrated for proper operation of the components. 
 Ensure the board is disconnected from power when doing the setup.
 <br>You can also setup using the images and PDF attached in the downloads folder.<br>
 6. Connect your arduino uno to the computer and any relevant power connection and start the experimnet
 7. Open youe excel application and setup as shown [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/education/data-streamer/connecting-serial-devices#data-format) or follow this [video instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvL0ut5phmM)
 8. Now data will be able to flow from the arduino uno to the excel application.
